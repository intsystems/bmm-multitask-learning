This repository contains the implementation of a **Bayesian Mixture Model (BMM) for Multitask Learning**, developed by the Intelligent Systems Group. The project focuses on learning shared representations across multiple related tasks using Bayesian nonparametric methods.

## Key Features

- Bayesian nonparametric approach to multitask learning
- Automatic determination of task relationships
- Flexible model architecture for heterogeneous tasks
- Efficient inference via variational methods or MCMC

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+

### Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/intsystems/bmm-multitask-learning.git
cd bmm-multitask-learning
poetry install
```
